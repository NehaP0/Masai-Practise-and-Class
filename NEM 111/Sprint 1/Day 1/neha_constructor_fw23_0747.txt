Constructor Function

The constructor method is a method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.
It is helpful when we want to create multiple objects.


class Flower {
  constructor() {
    this.petals = 5;
    this.color = red
  }
}

const flower1 = new Flower();
const flower2 = new Flower(); 

console.log(flower1.petals)
console.log(flower2.color)

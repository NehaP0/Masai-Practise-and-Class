Closure


It is a combination of functions with reference to its surrounding state, i.e. a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Example:

function parent(){
	let fruit = apple;
	function child(){
		console.log(fruit)
	}
	child()
}

parent()

Output: apple
